## Exploding Kittens Card Game üòº

Welcome to the Exploding Kittens card game! This is an online single-player card game where you try to draw cards from a deck without exploding kittens blowing up in your face. Let's dive into how the game works and how you can access it locally.

# How the Game Works

## Types of Cards:

- üòº Cat Card: Harmless card, just a cute cat.

 ## Gameplay
- Clicking on the deck reveals a card.
- If it's a cat card, it's removed from the deck.
- If it's an exploding kitten card and you don't have a defuse card, you lose.
- If it's a defuse card, it's removed from the deck and can be used to defuse an exploding kitten later.
- If it's a shuffle card, the game restarts with a freshly shuffled deck.
